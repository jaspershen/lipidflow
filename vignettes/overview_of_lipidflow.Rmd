# **Data organization**

***

## **Convert raw data to mzXML data**

The raw lipidomics data should be transferred to mzXML format files using [ProteoWizard software](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/). The parameter setting should be set as below figure shows:

![](../man/figures/msconventor.png)

***

## **Place mzXML data into a folder**

Then create a folder, and create "POS" and "NEG" folders in it, then put all the mzMXL data into the folders according to groups like the below figure shows:

***

## **Internal standard information**

To do absolute quantification, we need to provide the information of internal standard in the samples. The data should be "xlsx" format, and like the below figures shows:

![](../man/figures/2021_02_09_10.19.33_PM.png)
The first column is "name" (name of internal standards), the second column is "exact.mass" (exact mass of internal standards), the third column is "formula", the fourth column is "ug_ml" and the fifth column is "um". 

And then put the internal standard information in "POS" and "NEG" folders, respectively.

***

## **Lipid identification information**

The lipid identification table can be from any other software, for example, here we use the `lipidSearch` software from [Thermo](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/IQLAAEGABSFAPCMBFK?us&en#/IQLAAEGABSFAPCMBFK?us&en), and then put the lipid identification table (xlsx format) for positive and negative mode in "POS" and "NEG" folder respectively. 

The lipid identification table from `lipidSearch` is like the below figure shows:

# **Steps to get absolute quantification data of lipids**

***

## **Step 1: Get retention time of internal standards**

The step 1 is to get the retention time of internal standards. 

Please click [here](https://jaspershen.github.io/lipidflow/articles/get_is_retention_time.html).

***

## **Step 2: Get relative quantification data**

The step 2 is to get the relative quantification data of internal standards and lipids. 

Please click [here](https://jaspershen.github.io/lipidflow/articles/is_relative_quantification.html).

***

## **Step 3: Get absolute quantification data**

The step 3 is to get the absolute quantification data of internal standards and lipids. 

Please click [here](https://jaspershen.github.io/lipidflow/articles/absolute_quantification.html).

***

## **Step 4: Output and organize results**

The step 4 is to output and organize results.

Please click [here](https://jaspershen.github.io/lipidflow/articles/output_result.html).

***

# **One function to finish all steps**

We can also use one function (`get_lipid_absolute_quantification()`) to finish all previous steps.
